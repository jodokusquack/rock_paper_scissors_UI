# rock_paper_scissors_js

This is a JavaScript Project from "[The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/courses/web-development-101/lessons/rock-paper-scissors?ref=lnav "The Odin Project")".

The Game is played entirely from the console, so you have to open it to play. 
It consists of five rounds of **"Rock, Paper, Scissors"** until either the Player or the Computer wins.

Thanks fpr playing!
